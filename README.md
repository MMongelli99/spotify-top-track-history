# spotify-top-track-history
An improvement on the "On Repeat" playlist Spotify creates for its users, this playlist not only saves your current favorite tracks, it continuously accumulates them. This program creates a rolling playlist called "On Repeat Forever," which begins by adding your past top tracks and from then on continuously adds your new current top tracks. Simply run the script to update the playlist. To begin: clone the repository, fill out your credentials in credentials.py, and then run main.py.
